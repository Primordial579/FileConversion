⚠️ Windows SmartScreen Notice

When you download and run the .exe for the first time, Windows may show a warning such as:

“Windows protected your PC” or “This file may contain a virus”

This is normal behavior for custom or unsigned applications.
Since the executable is not signed with a verified publisher certificate, Windows treats it as unrecognized software.
